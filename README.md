# Surfs_Up

## Overview
W. Avy had asked us to create a databases, tables, and analysis for their upcoming surf and ice cream shop business. And, if all goes well, they may expand to other islands. W. Avy is mainly concerned about temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu. This will make a difference in determining whether the surf and ice cream shop is worthwhile year-round.

## Results
![June temperature table](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/Surfs_Up/blob/main/June.png)
![December temperature table](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Decemeber.png)
- The maximum temperature during the month of June and December are not far off from eachother, where June is 85 degrees and December is 82 degrees.
- The average temperate during the month of June and December are similar as well as the maximum, where June is around 75 degrees and December is 71 degrees.
- The minimum temperature is slightly less close in June and December than maximum and average temperatures, where June is 64 degrees and December is 56 degrees. Though, both od these temperatures are relatively hot, and could be merely a few days out of the whole month. 

## Summary (other locations that they had in mind, humidity)
Throughout the duration of helping W. Avy create databases and tables for their new surf and ice cream shop, we have gathered that June and December temperatures are relatively similar and therefore the business would be sustainable year-round.
### Two additional queries
- Different locations temperatures that they may have had in mind or were looking to expand to, for reference.
- Humidity and precipitation in relation to the specific location and months.
